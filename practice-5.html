                <h1>Practice 5 - Montecarlo Laser Localization</h1>

                <h2>Montecarlo Localization: (Video)</h2>

                <div class="video-container">
                    <video src="videos/video-p5-1.webm" controls width="600"></video>
                </div>

                <p>
                    In this first video, we demonstrate how the Monte Carlo localization algorithm converges to a solution that closely matches the robot's real orientation. As shown, the particles group around the robot's real position, but the simulated robot experiences a slight displacement in its X and Y coordinates. This small position error is common due to sensor imperfections and the inherent uncertainty in the localization process. However, the robot's orientation is fairly accurate, allowing for proper navigation within the map.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This type of behavior is expected in situations where the algorithm has achieved "convergence" in terms of orientation but has not yet fully adjusted the robot's position. The system uses the particles to make a gradual approximation and improve the localization accuracy as the robot moves and gathers more environmental data.
                </p>

                <div class="video-container">
                    <video src="videos/video-p5-2.webm" controls width="600"></video>
                </div>

                <p>
                    In this second video, the robot is shown to be closer to its real position in terms of X and Y coordinates, but it has an issue with its orientation. Instead of aligning correctly with the robot's real angle, the localization system calculates an incorrect orientation. Although the position is more accurate, the robot's orientation does not match the real one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This error can be caused by several factors, such as poor weight calculations for the particles during the resampling phase or errors in the laser reading computations. It is a common challenge in Monte Carlo-based localization, where the algorithm must resolve both position and orientation simultaneously, which can be more difficult when the robot is in areas with limited environmental information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, with more runtime and more sensor information, the algorithm is capable of correcting this orientation error, getting closer to the correct configuration in both position and orientation.
                </p>

                <h2>Practice difficulties:</h2>

                <p>
                    Throughout the implementation of the Monte Carlo Localization algorithm in this practice, several challenges arose that required specific adjustments to ensure proper functionality. Below are some of the key difficulties encountered:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Correct weight calculation considering obstacles and other factors</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Resampling: Eliminating the particle with the lowest weight</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Accurate theoretical laser scan calculation and raycasting</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    One of the first challenges was the <strong>calculation of weights</strong> for each particle. The weights are essential to determine which particles best represent the robot's actual position, but they must also take into account the presence of obstacles. At first, the weight calculation only considered the differences between real and theoretical laser scans. However, obstacles in the environment play a crucial role in the robot’s positioning, and if a particle is found in an area with obstacles, its weight should be significantly reduced.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To improve this, the weight calculation formula was adjusted to incorporate a <strong>penalty for particles that are located in areas with obstacles</strong>. We penalized particles whose positions were found inside the obstacles detected by the map. Additionally, we introduced a distance-based weighting system, where particles farther from the robot’s known position had their weights reduced, further improving the accuracy of the localization process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The second major challenge was the <strong>resampling process</strong>, which is used to eliminate particles with low weights and reinforce the particles with higher weights. The algorithm requires selecting the best particles based on their likelihood of representing the robot's true position, but if the particle set contains too many particles with low weights, this leads to a poor localization estimate.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To address this, a function was added to <strong>eliminate the particle with the lowest weight</strong> after every resampling phase. This helped to ensure that the particles that survived the resampling step were the ones that more accurately represented the robot’s location, while minimizing the impact of any incorrect particles that were far off the true position.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, the <strong>calculation of the theoretical laser scan</strong> and the associated raycasting process required careful attention. Each particle’s laser scan must match the actual scan generated by the robot’s laser sensors, which involves calculating a set of rays extending from the particle’s position in the environment. Initially, there were issues with the raycasting process where rays would incorrectly pass through walls or fail to detect obstacles accurately.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To improve this, we ensured that the <strong>raycasting calculations were properly adjusted</strong> to handle different angles and distances, ensuring that each particle’s laser scan was more accurate and closely matched the real-world data. The rays were now being cast correctly from the particle’s position, accounting for obstacles and ensuring that the calculated distances matched the expected behavior of a laser scan in a real-world environment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In conclusion, these difficulties highlight the complexity of implementing a robust Monte Carlo Localization algorithm, especially in the context of real-world environments with obstacles and noise. However, with the proper adjustments to weight calculations, resampling, and raycasting, the algorithm was able to achieve accurate localization, providing a foundation for further improvements in mobile robot navigation.
                </p>

                <h2>Tests carried out:</h2>  
                
                <p>
                    Throughout the implementation and development of the Monte Carlo Localization algorithm, several tests were carried out to evaluate its performance under different conditions. Below are some of the key tests conducted during the practice:
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The first step in testing the algorithm was <strong>initializing the particles randomly</strong> across the map. This process is crucial as the initial distribution of particles determines the starting point for the localization process. Initially, particles were randomly generated in a region around the robot's true position, but with some variation. By observing how the particles dispersed around the robot, we could see how well the algorithm approximated the robot’s location.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    During testing, I experimented with different values for the number of particles, starting with a small number and gradually increasing the particle count. For example, when <strong>N_PARTICLES</strong> was set to 50, the algorithm would often struggle to converge accurately on the true position. The fewer particles there are, the more likely it is that the robot’s localization estimate will be imprecise. On the other hand, with a larger number of particles, such as 300, the algorithm performed better at estimating the robot’s position, though at the cost of more computational time.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    To further explore the effect of the number of particles on performance, I tested the algorithm with both a low and high number of particles, specifically <strong>1 particle</strong> and <strong>several hundred particles</strong>. With only 1 particle, the robot's position could often diverge, as the particle might be too far from the actual position. In contrast, when the number of particles increased, the algorithm's estimate of the robot’s position became more reliable, as there was a wider distribution of particles to choose from. However, even with many particles, the algorithm occasionally struggled in areas with significant noise or obstacles, requiring further adjustments to the weight calculation and resampling methods.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Another crucial aspect of the testing was observing how the <strong>weights</strong> of the particles were established during the process. The weight of each particle is a measure of how likely it is to represent the robot's actual position. Initially, when particles were randomly distributed, the weights were all quite low because they were far from the true position. As the Monte Carlo Localization algorithm iterated and particles were propagated based on odometry data and laser scans, the weights started to reflect the particles that were closer to the robot’s real position. I was able to observe how the particles with higher weights clustered around the true position of the robot, while the particles with low weights were eliminated during the resampling process.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    To test the accuracy and robustness of the localization algorithm, I ran several iterations of the Monte Carlo Localization with various parameters. For instance, the number of particles was varied, and the system was tested with both simple and complex map environments, containing obstacles like walls and narrow passages. These tests helped to highlight potential areas of improvement, such as adjusting the weight calculation when particles were near obstacles or in open spaces. In some cases, the algorithm would struggle to converge properly if the laser scan data had inconsistencies, such as gaps or noisy readings.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Lastly, the algorithm was tested using the <strong>same structure from Practice 1</strong> where the robot moved forward, backward, and turned based on bumper sensors. This setup provided a good environment to test how well the Monte Carlo Localization algorithm could handle continuous motion and real-time updates. The combination of movement and periodic updates to particle positions allowed the system to continuously refine the robot's estimated pose, making the algorithm suitable for real-time localization in dynamic environments.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Through these various tests, it became clear that the algorithm could successfully localize the robot in many situations. However, it also highlighted areas where improvements could be made, such as refining the resampling process, improving weight calculations in complex environments, and addressing cases where the laser scan data might not be perfect.
